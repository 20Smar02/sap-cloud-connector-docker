# SAP Cloud Connector in Docker

Easily setup SAPCC in docker.

## Instructions

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)

**Windows:** Make sure you are running on Windows 10! For installing Docker you will need admin rights on your machine. Furthermore, you might have to run your Terminal/CLI as "Administrator" in case your current user is not an admin user (i.e. GitBash, PowerShell).

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com)

    On Windows I suggest to install Git Bash as well (you'll be asked during the installation process).

    **Hint:** Installing git is actually not really needed. Alternatively, you could also copy/download this Dockerfile to yor machine.

1. Clone this repo

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nzamani/sap-cloud-connector-docker.git
    cd sap-cloud-connector-docker
    ```

1. Build the Docker image

    - Without Proxy

        ```sh
        docker build -t sapcc:2.11.0.3 .
        ```

    - Behind a Proxy

        ```sh
        docker build --build-arg http_proxy=http://proxy.mycompany.corp:1234 --build-arg https_proxy=http://proxy.mycompany.corp:1234 -t sapcc:2.11.0.3 .
        ```

        **Hint:** In a proxy environment your `docker build` command (see above) will fail in case you don't set the proxy as mentioned above or in case you use wrong proxy settings. Also consider that you might have to set the proxy manually for some software installed in the container, i.e. for the SAPCC you can set it manually for each SAPCP connection.


1. Create a container running as a deamon

    - Use this if you want to map the default SAP ports as they come on localhost (preferred)

        ```sh
        docker run -p 8443:8443 -h mysapcc --name sapcc -d sapcc:2.11.0.3
        ```

    - Use this one if "random" ports on localhost are fine for you

        ```sh
        docker run -P -h mysapcc --name sapcc -d sapcc:2.11.0.3
        ```

1. Starting/Stopping the container

    - **Starting:** `docker start sapcc`
    - **Stopping:** `docker stop sapcc`

1. Post Installation Steps

    Logon to [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443) with the default credentials:

      - **User:** Administrator
      - **Password:** manage

    You will be asked to change your password.

    **Hint:** It might take a few seconds after you can access [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443). This is because the SAP Cloud Connector needs some time to start (even though the Docker Container has immediately started).

1. Proxy Settings

    A proxy can be set manually for each SAPCP connection after [logging on](https://localhost:8443) to the SAPCC using a browser. Make sure to use the correct proxy settings (incl. credentials if required), otherwise your SAPCC might not be able to connect to your SAPCC account.

## Docker Configuration and Commands

### Creating a Network called `saptrial`

```sh
docker network create -d bridge saptrial
```

### Connect Container `sapcc` to Network `saptrial` + make `sapcc` available via alias `mysapcc`

```sh
docker network connect --alias mysapcc saptrial sapcc
```

### Putting an existing NW ABAP Container onto the same Network (with different aliases)

```sh
docker network connect --alias vhcalnplci saptrial nwabap751
docker network connect --alias vhcalnplci.dummy.nodomain saptrial nwabap751
```

### Removing Containers from Docker Networks

```sh
docker network disconnect saptrial nwabap751
docker network disconnect saptrial sapcc
```

### Deleting/Removing a Docker Network

```sh
docker network rm saptrial
```

### Creating a Docker Image from Docker Containers (i.e. for "backup")

```sh
# Suggestion: stop the container you want to backup before continuing
docker stop sapcc

# create an image "sapccbackup" from the container "sapcc"
docker commit sapcc sapccbackup:1
# later you can create a new container from the new image "sapccimage"
# Hint: if the ports etc are already used by other containers you must use different ports (or i.e. deleting the other containers first)
docker run -p 8443:8443 -h mysapcc --name sapccNewContainer -d sapccbackup:1
```
